# Claude Tools Project: Booking Bot


The project will be a Claude chat bot that helps us check and reserve tables at a restaurant (data stored as a CSV file on disk).

## Setting Up

I normally like to use a virtual environment in Python to set up my dependencies.

```sh
# Create a virtual environment named "venv".
python -m venv venv

# Active the environment (on Mac or Linux — other shells may differ).
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies (frozen to this project's version — but you can try using latest if you want).

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will also need an API key from https://console.anthropic.com/. Go there to set up an account, upgrade to "builder" plan, add credits, then get an API key. Then add it to your environment variable.

```sh
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

## Data Source

The data source is a CSV file on disk at `data/bookings.csv`. The bot will have access to this file, and will be able to modify it.

The data shows which tables / times are available (if free), or the name of whoever has booked that slot.

Here's an example of the data.

Here's the table expressed as markdown, truncated to 4 columns and 4 rows:

| time  | table1 (2p) | table2 (2p) | table3 (2p) |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 12:00 |             | Jones       |             |
| 12:30 | Anderson    | Liam H      | Jackson K   |
| 13:00 | Li          | Patel       | Johnson     |
| 13:30 | Martin      |             |             |

## Available Tools

The tools will be implemented as separate Python functions. We will have three tools.

```python
def ask_user(input_prompt: str) -> str:
    # Show an input prompt so the user can chat / enter information.
```

```python
def get_booking_slots(party_size: int, time: str):
    # Which tables (of "party size") are free near the desired time (e.g. 9:30)?
```

```python
def book_table(table_name: str, time: str, reservation_name: str) -> bool:
    # Show an input prompt so the user can chat / enter information.
```

## Booking Bot Implementation

The actual bot (using the tool) is implemented in `booking_bot.py`. It is structured to continue prompting and responding to the user in a loop (until the booking is made, or cancelled).

It can be used like this:

```sh
python booking_bot.py
```

Example output and conversation flow:

```
💬 Tell me about the time/seats you'd like to book.
👉 Enter Message: Any tables available at 7pm?
✨ System Response: Certainly! I'd be happy to help you check for available tables at 7 PM. However, to provide you with accurate information, I'll need to know how many people will be in your party. This information is essential for finding a suitable table. Let me ask you for that detail.

💬 How many people will be in your party for the 7 PM reservation?
👉 Enter Message: 2
🛠️ Using Tool [ask_user]: 2

✨ System Response: Thank you for providing that information. Now I can check for available tables at 7 PM for a party of 2. Let me search for you.

🛠️ Using Tool [get_booking_slots]: ['🕒 18:00 - table3 (2p)', '🕒 19:30 - table2 (2p)', '🕒 20:00 - table1 (2p)', '🕒 20:00 - table2 (2p)', '🕒 20:00 - table4 (2p)', '🕒 20:00 - table7 (4p)']

✨ System Response: I've checked the available booking slots for a party of 2 around 7 PM. Unfortunately, there isn't a table available exactly at 7 PM, but I can offer you some alternatives:

1. Earlier option:
   - 6:00 PM (18:00) - table3 (2-person table)

2. Later options:
   - 7:30 PM (19:30) - table2 (2-person table)
   - 8:00 PM (20:00) - multiple tables available (table1, table2, table4 - all 2-person tables)

Would you like to book one of these available times, or would you prefer to check for a different time or party size?

💬 Please let me know if you'd like to book one of these times or if you'd like to explore other options.
👉 Enter Message: Let's book something at 6pm.
🛠️ Using Tool [ask_user]: Let's book something at 6pm.

✨ System Response: Excellent choice! I'm happy to help you book a table for 6:00 PM (18:00). To confirm, we have a table for 2 people available at that time. Before I make the reservation, I just need one more piece of information from you.

💬 Under what name would you like to make the reservation?
👉 Enter Message: Bhuvan
